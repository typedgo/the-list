# About

## Motiviation

- The advantage of failing early with compile-time errors provided with type-safe code.
- The difficulty of discovering universally applicable and well tested tools among the endless options of overly specific and under tested others.

## Criteria

- Tool's main goal is replacing a non type-safe code with type safe Go code.
- Tool solve a common-enough problem that the author is not the single one suffers from it.
- Tool is well maintained and tested.
- Tool follows semver constraints.
- Tool provides a binary and not exclusively an online service (for easier integration).
- Tool accounts edge cases in input code with utilites correct AST manipulation and constructing practices and doesn't solely depend on textual operations.
